# Data cleaning before treatment

## Avoid errors in raw data

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the machine learning process as it helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the models built on the data. Raw data often contains errors, inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, which can negatively impact the performance of machine learning algorithms. By cleaning and preprocessing the data, such as filling in missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing data, the machine learning models can make more accurate predictions and decisions. 

## Good interpretability of the result

Additionally, data cleaning can also help to reduce bias and increase the interpretability of the results, which is important for making informed decisions based on the outcomes of the machine learning models. Therefore, data cleaning is an essential step in preparing data for machine learning, and should not be overlooked or underestimated.
